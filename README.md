## Connecting to Backstage

To connect this app to Backstage, you'll need to add it to your Backstage software catalog. This involves creating a `catalog-info.yaml` file in this repository that describes the app and its metadata. The Backstage documentation provides detailed instructions on how to do this.

Once you've added the `catalog-info.yaml` file to this repository, you can import the app into Backstage by navigating to the 'Catalog' tab and clicking on the 'Register Existing Component' button. Enter the URL of this repository and click 'Analyze'. Backstage will automatically detect the `catalog-info.yaml` file and add the app to your software catalog.
